## Development Notes

### Model Selection Process
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Applied SMOTE to balance 800-sample dataset
2. **Algorithm Comparison**: Evaluated three classification algorithms
   - Decision Tree: 86% accuracy
   - Random Forest: 93% accuracy (selected)
   - XGBoost: 90% accuracy
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Used RandomizedSearchCV for optimization
4. **Validation**: 5-fold cross-validation for robust performance estimation

### Technical Decisions
- **Random Forest**: Selected for best performance and interpretability
- **FastAPI**: Chosen for automatic documentation and type safety
- **React**: Modern frontend framework with excellent ecosystem
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS for rapid development
- **Vite**: Fast build tool for development and production

### Performance Optimizations
- Model inference time: <100ms per prediction
- Frontend bundle size: <500KB gzipped
- API response time: <200ms average
- Mobile-optimized responsive design

### Security Considerations
- No personal data storage (stateless design)
- HTTPS encryption in production
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS configuration for allowed origins
- Environment variable management

## Future Roadmap

### Planned Features
- Multi-language support for international users
